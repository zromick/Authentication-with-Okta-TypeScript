## About This Fork

The initial app comes from here [Authentication with Okta](https://github.com/smashingmagazine/Authentiaction-with-Okta).
This forked app provides a solution for those using TypeScript. It also removes some unneeded files.

You'll need to replace your oktaBaseURL and oktaClientId to get things working (in config.tsx)
